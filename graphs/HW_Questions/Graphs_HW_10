Longest Path In Weighted DAG



Problem Statement:



Given a weighted DAG (directed acyclic graph), where weight of an edge denotes the length of that edge.



Nodes in the graph are numbered from 1 to dag_nodes, where dag_nodes denotes the total number of nodes in the graph.



Also, you are given a node from_node and a node to_node. You have to find longest path from from_node to to_node in the given graph. 



Input Format:



There are six arguments.



First one is an integer dag_nodes, second one is an array dag_from, third one is an array dag_to and forth one is an array dag_weight. These four arguments cumulatively describes the weighted DAG. dag_nodes describes the total number of nodes in the given graph and there is an edge from dag_from[i] node to dag_to[i] node with length dag_weight[i].



Fifth argument is from_node and sixth argument is to_node.  



Output Format:



Return an array describing longest path from from_node to to_node.



There can be multiple longest paths, so you are free to return any of them. 



Constraints:



Given graph is a valid weighted DAG.
Given graph does not contain multiple edges. 
to_node is reachable from from_node.
1 <= dag_nodes <= 450
1 <= dag_from[i], dag_to[i], from_node, to_node <= dag_nodes
1 <= dag_weight[i] <= 2 * 10^9
Total number of edges in graph <= (dag_nodes * (dag_nodes - 1)) / 2


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



dag_nodes = 4

dag_from = [1 1 1 3]

dag_to = [2 3 4 4]

dag_weight = [2 2 4 3]

from_node = 1

to_node = 4



Sample Output:



[1 3 4]



Explanation:



Total there are two paths from node 1 to node 4.

1) 1 -> 4 with length 4.

2) 1 -> 3 -> 4 with length 2 + 3 = 5.

So, Longest path from node 1 to node 4 is [1 3 4] with length 5.



Notes:



Suggested time in interview: 30 minutes.

The “Suggested Time” is the time expected to complete this question during a real-life interview, not now in homework i.e. For the first attempt of a given homework problem, the focus should be to understand what the problem is asking, what approach you are using, coding it, as well as identifying any gaps that you can discuss during a TA session. Take your time, but limit yourself to 2 one hour sessions for most problems.



When from_node = to_node, path contains only one node, so output should be [from_node] containing only one node. 



It can be helpful to first store edges node wise and then use it.

Something like this:



vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> node_wise_edges(dag_nodes + 1, vector<pair<int, int>>(0));

for (int i = 0; i < dag_edges; i++)

{

    node_wise_edges[dag_from[i]].push_back({dag_to[i], dag_weight[i]});

}



Now we have all the outgoing edges from node i in vector node_wise_edges[i]. And it will be easier to use. 

vector<int> find_longest_path(int dag_nodes, vector <int> dag_from, vector <int> dag_to, vector <int> dag_weight, int from_node, int to_node);
