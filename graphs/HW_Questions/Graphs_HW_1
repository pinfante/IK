Find Order Of Characters From Alien Dictionary



Problem Statement:



Given a sorted dictionary of an alien language. You have to find the order of characters in that language. 

(This a popular interview problem)



Input Format:



There is only one argument, array of strings which denotes sorted dictionary of an alien language. 



Output Format:



Return a string denoting order of characters in the alien language. 



Length of the output string will be the number of different characters present in input dictionary.  



For more clarity see the sample test cases.



Constraints:



1 <= total number of characters in dictionary (not words) <= 10^5
Character in any word will be lower case alphabet letter.
Input will be such that it is possible to determine the order uniquely. 


Sample Test Cases:



Sample Input1:



words = ["baa", "abcd", "abca", "cab", "cad"]



Sample Output1:



"bdac"



Sample Input2:



words = ["caa", "aaa", "aab"]



Sample Output2:



"cab"



Notes:

Here input is given such that it is possible to determine order uniquely. But in interview you should clarify these things with interviewer. Like if we are given words = ["z" "bc"] then we can only conclude that 'z' will come before 'b', but nothing about the order of 'c'! 



string find_order(vector<string> words);
