Snakes and Ladders Matrix





Problem Statement:



Given a snake and ladder rectangular MxN board-game, find the minimum number of dice throws required to reach the final cell from the 1st cell. 



Rules are as usual: If after a dice-throw, the player reaches a cell where the ladder starts, the player has to climb up that ladder and if the player reaches a cell that has the mouth of the snake, s/he has to go down to the tail of snake.



For example, in the board given below, it will take minimum 4 throws to reach from 1 to 36. That can be done with the following sequence of throws: (1,6,4,1). There may be more such sequences of the same length viz. (4,2,6,3) etc. 





​



Input Format:



You will be given an integer n denoting the size of the board and an array of integer moves of length n, denoting if there is a ladder or a snake as follows:

moves[i] = -1, No ladder and no snake
moves[i] < i, Snake from i to moves[i]
moves[i] > i, Ladder from i to moves[i]
moves array has one-based indexing.



Output Format:



Return an integer denoting the minimum number of dice rolls required to reach the last cell.



Constraints:



1 <= n <= 10^5

1 <= moves[i] <= n



Note:

You start at cell 1.
There is no snake at the last cell and no ladder at the first cell.
No snake starts at the top of a ladder or bottom of a snake. No ladder starts at the bottom of the snake or top of a ladder.
Return -1 if there is no possible way.


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input-1:



n = 20

moves = [-1, 19, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 3, -1, -1, 16, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]



Sample Output-1:



2



Explanation-1:



You start at cell 1. You roll 1 to go to cell 2 to take the stairs to cell 19. You roll 1 again to reach the last cell, 20.



1 --> (2~19) --> 20



int minNumberOfRolls(int n, vector<int> moves);
