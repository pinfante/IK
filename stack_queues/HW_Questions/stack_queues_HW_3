Maximum In Sliding Window





Problem Statement:



An integer array named arr is given to you. Size of arr is n and assume that it is very large.



There is a sliding window of size w which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the w numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves rightwards by one position. You have to find maximum number in the window each time. 



Input Format:



There are two arguments in input. First is an integer array arr. Second is the window width w.



Output Format:



Return an array, where i-th number of the returned array contains the maximum number from arr[i] to arr[i+w-1].



Constraints:



1 <= n <= 10^5
-2 * 10^9 <= arr[i] <= 2 * 10^9
1 <= w <= n


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



arr = [1 3 -1 -3 5 3 6 7]

w = 3



Sample Output:



[3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]



Explanation:



Window Position -> Max



1) [1 3 -1] -3 5 3 6 7 -> 3

2) 1 [3 -1 -3] 5 3 6 7 -> 3

3) 1 3 [-1 -3 5] 3 6 7 -> 5

4) 1 3 -1 [-3 5 3] 6 7 -> 5

5) 1 3 -1 -3 [5 3 6] 7 -> 6

6) 1 3 -1 -3 5 [3 6 7] -> 7
