Group the numbers 





Problem Statement:



You are given an array of non-negative integers only. Group them in-place into evens and odds in such a way that all evens appear on the left side and all odds on the right side.



Input Format:



0 <= element <= 10^9



Integer array
Repeats possible.


Output Format:



Return the same integer array, with evens on left side and odds on the right side. There is no need to preserve order within odds or within evens.



Constraints:



1 <= n <= 10^5

Given array may contain duplicate numbers.

Solutions with linear time complexity and constant auxiliary space is expected.



Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



[1, 2, 3, 4]



Sample Output:



[4, 2, 1, 3]



Explanation:



Order does not matter. Other valid solutions are

[2, 4, 1, 3]

[2, 4, 3, 1]

[4, 2, 3, 1]
