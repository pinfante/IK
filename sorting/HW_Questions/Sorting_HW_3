Top K



Problem Statement:



You are given an array of integers which is analogous to a continuous stream of input. Find K largest elements from a given stream of numbers. By definition, we don't know the size of the input stream. Hence produce K largest elements seen so far, at any given time. For repeated numbers, return them only once.



If there are less than K unique elements, return all of them.



Note:

Represent input stream as an array. Don't rely on its size.
Feel free to use built-in functions if you need a specific data-structure.


Input Format:



Integer array
Repeats are possible
Input may or may not be sorted


Output Format:



Return an integer array containing K largest elements. If there are less than K unique elements, return all of them. If there are duplicates, return only one instance.
Order of output does not matter.


Constraints:



1 <= N <= 10^5

1 <= K <= 10^5

Given array may contain duplicate numbers.



Sample Test Case:



Sample Input-1:



arr = [1, 5, 4, 4, 2]; k = 2



Sample Output-1:



[4, 5]



Sample Input-2:



arr = [1, 5, 1, 5, 1]; k = 3



Sample Output-2:



[5, 1]



ector <int> topK(vector <int> arr, int k);
