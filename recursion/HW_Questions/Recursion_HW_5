Palindromic Decomposition Of A String





Problem Statement:



A palindromic decomposition of string is a decomposition of the string into sub-strings, such that all those sub-strings are valid palindromes.



Given a string s, you have to find ALL possible palindromic decompositions of it.



Input Format:



There is only one argument denoting string s.



Output Format:



Return array of string containing ALL possible palindromic decompositions of given string. 



To differentiate sub-strings in the decomposed string add '|' between them. (Look at the sample test cases for more clarity.)



You need not to worry about the order of strings in your output array. Like for s = "aa", arrays ["a|a", "aa"] and ["aa", "a|a"] both will be accepted. (Also note that string itself is also a sub-string.)



Any string in the returned array should not contain any spaces. e.g. s = "ab" then ["a|b"] is expected, ["a |b"] or ["a| b"] or ["a | b"] will give wrong answer.



Constraints:



1 <= |s| <= 20
s only contains lowercase letters ('a' - 'z').
You have to return ALL possible palindromic decompositions.
In any string in your returned array, order of characters should remain same as in given string. (i.e. for s = "ab" you should return ["a|b"] and not ["b|a"].)


Sample Test Cases:



Sample Input:



"abracadabra"



Sample Output:



[

    "a|b|r|a|c|a|d|a|b|r|a",

    "a|b|r|a|c|ada|b|r|a",

    "a|b|r|aca|d|a|b|r|a"

]


vector <string> generate_palindromic_decompositions(string s);
