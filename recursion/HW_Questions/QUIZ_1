Possible To Achieve Target Sum?





Problem Statement:



Given an array arr of size n and a target sum k. 



You have to determine, whether there exists a group of numbers (numbers need not to be contiguous and group can not be empty) in arr such that their sum equals to k.



Input Format:



There are two argument. First one is arr and second one is k.



Output Format:



Return a boolean denoting your answer.  



Constraints:



1 <= n <= 18
-10^17 <= arr[i], k <= 10^17


Sample Test Cases:



Sample Input 1:



arr = [2 4 8]

k = 6



Sample Output 1:



True



Explanation 1:



arr[0] + arr[1] = 6



Sample Input 2:



arr = [2 4 6]

k = 5



Sample Output 2:



False



Explanation 2:



There does not exists any group such that its sum equals to k.


bool check_if_sum_possible(vector <long long int> arr, long long int k);
