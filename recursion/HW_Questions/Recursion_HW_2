Generate All Subsets Of A Set

Problem Statement:

Given a set (string s containing only distinct lowercase letters ('a' - 'z')), you have to generate ALL possible subsets of it . 

Note that empty set is always a subset of any set.

Input Format:

There is only one argument denoting string s.

Output Format:

Return array of strings containing ALL possible subsets of given string.

You need not to worry about order of strings in your output array. Like for s = "a", arrays ["", "a"] and ["a", ""] 
both will be accepted.

Order of characters in any subset must be same as in the input string. For s = "xy", array ["", "x", "y", "xy"] 
will be accepted, but ["", "x", "y", "yx"] will not be accepted. 

Constraints:

0 <= |s| <= 20
s only contains distinct lowercase alphabetical letters ('a' - 'z').
You have to return ALL possible subsets. 

Sample Test Cases:

Sample Input:

"xy" 

Sample Output:

["", "x", "y", "xy"] 

vector<string> generate_all_subsets(const string& s, string subStr, vector<string>& v, size_t i);
