Kth Smallest Element Of BST





Problem Statement:



Given a BST (binary search tree) of size N containing integer elements and an integer k. You have to find kth smallest element of given BST.



Input Format:



There are two arguments in the input. First one is the root of the BST and second one is an integer k.



Output Format:



Return an integer denoting kth smallest element of BST.



Constraints:



1 <= N <= 6000
1 <= k <= N
-2 * 10^9 <= value stored in any node <= 2 * 10^9
BST need not to be balanced.
You are not allowed to alter the structure or data inside the given BST. 


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



BST =

2 is the root node.

1 is 2's left child.

3 is 2's right child. 



k = 3



Sample Output:



3



Explanation:



3rd smallest element is 3.
