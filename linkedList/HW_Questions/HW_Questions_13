Reverse Given Linked List In Groups Of k





Problem Statement:



Given an integer singly linked list of size n and an integer k, you have to reverse every k nodes of the linked list.



There are two cases possible:



1) When n % k = 0: There will be n / k groups of size k. So, you have to reverse n / k groups of size k.



2) When n % k != 0: There will be floor(n / k) groups of size k and one group of size n % k. So, you have to reverse floor(n / k) groups of size k and one group of size n % k. 



(Looking at sample test cases will make it more clear.)



Input Format:



There are two arguments in input. First is an integer singly linked list and second is an integer k.



Output Format:



Return linked list after reversing it in groups of k. 



Constraints:



1 <= n <= 100000
-2 * 10^9 <= value stored in any node <= 2 * 10^9
1 <= k <= n
Solve it with constant extra space.


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input 1:



list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL

k: 3



Sample Output 1:

 

3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> NULL



Explanation 1:



n = 6, k = 3 hence n % k = 0. So there are n / k = 6 / 3 = 2 groups of size k = 3. 



Groups to be reversed are (1 -> 2 -> 3) and (4 -> 5 -> 6). 



Sample Input 2:



list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> NULL

k: 3



Sample Output 2:

 

3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 8 -> 7-> NULL



Explanation 2:



n = 8, k = 3 hence n % k != 0, so there are floor(n / k) = floor(8 / 3) = 2 groups of size k = 3 and one group of size n % k = 8 % 3 = 2. 



Groups to be reversed are (1 -> 2 -> 3), (4 -> 5 -> 6) and (7 -> 8).
