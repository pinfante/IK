Find Median Of Sorted Circular Singly Linked List

Problem Statement:

Given a pointer ptr to an arbitrary node of a sorted circular singly linked list L containing only even integers. You have to find the median value M of L.

When even number of elements in L, then the median M is average of two middle elements. 

Input Format:

There is only one argument, ptr denoting a pointer to an arbitrary node of L.

Output Format:

Return one integer denoting the median M.

Constraints:

1 <= Number of nodes in linked list <= 10^5
- 2 * 10^9 <= value contained in nodes <= 2 * 10^9 
Value contained in nodes will be even number. (Hence when even number of elements in L, median M will be an integer. (even + even) / 2 = integer (aka, not float). So answer will always be integer (never float).)


Sample Test Case:

Sample Input:

L: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10


ptr: Pointer of the node containing value 4. 

Sample Output:
6

Explanation:

There are 5 nodes in L hence median M will be the value of 3rd node, which is 6. 

Notes:

Expected solution: Linear time complexity with constant extra space.
