Divide An Integer By Another Integer





Problem Statement:



Given two integers a and b. You have to find quotient q, when a is divided by b. 



Input Format:



Two integers a and b.



Output Format:



Quotient q of a/b.



Constraints:



-10^18 <= a, b <= 10^18
b != 0
You are not allowed to use division (/) operator.
You are not allowed to use multiplication (*) operator.
You are not allowed to use mod (%) operator.


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



a = 5, b = 2



Sample Output:



2



Notes:

Here we have mentioned explicitly that b != 0, but in interview you should clarify this with the interviewer and handle the case accordingly.
