Detect Prime Numbers





Problem Statement:



Given an integer array a of size N. For each integer in a we have to check if it is a prime number or not.



Input Format:



There is only one argument denoting integer array a.



Output Format:



Return a string of size N, where ith character of string contains ‘1’ if a[i] is a prime number else it should contain ‘0’. (1 is neither a prime nor a composite number, hence according to the previous statement, it should go in else part, i.e. ith character should contain '0', when a[i] = 1.)



Constraints:



1 <= a[i] <= 4 * 10^6
1 <= N <= 3 * 10^5


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



[6, 2, 5, 8]



Sample Output:



0110



Explanation:



6 is not a prime number. (6 = 2 * 3)

2 is a prime number.

5 is a prime number.

8 is not a prime number. (8 = 2 * 4)
